The dataset is collected from GroupLens Research website : https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/

The project has:
  - Data Analysis that compares the correlation between users or items.
  - Models and clusterings including Kmeans, Naive Bayes.
  - For each result from the models, has analysis including: precision recall + curve, similarity matrix, ROC curve
